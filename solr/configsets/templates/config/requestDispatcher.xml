      <!-- Request Dispatcher

       This section contains instructions for how the SolrDispatchFilter
       should behave when processing requests for this SolrCore.

  <requestDispatcher>
    <!-- Request Parsing

         These settings indicate how Solr Requests may be parsed, and
         what restrictions may be placed on the ContentStreams from
         those requests

         enableRemoteStreaming - enables use of the stream.file
         and stream.url parameters for specifying remote streams.

         multipartUploadLimitInKB - specifies the max size (in KiB) of
         Multipart File Uploads that Solr will allow in a Request.

         formdataUploadLimitInKB - specifies the max size (in KiB) of
         form data (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) sent via
         POST. You can use POST to pass request parameters not
         fitting into the URL.

         addHttpRequestToContext - if set to true, it will instruct
         the requestParsers to include the original HttpServletRequest
         object in the context map of the SolrQueryRequest under the
         key "httpRequest". It will not be used by any of the existing
         Solr components, but may be useful when developing custom
         plugins.

         *** WARNING ***
         Before enabling remote streaming, you should make sure your
         system has authentication enabled.

    <requestParsers enableRemoteStreaming="false"
                    multipartUploadLimitInKB="-1"
                    formdataUploadLimitInKB="-1"
                    addHttpRequestToContext="false"/>

    <!-- HTTP Caching

         Set HTTP caching related parameters (for proxy caches and clients).

         The options below instruct Solr not to output any HTTP Caching
         related headers
      -->
    <httpCaching never304="true" />
    <!-- If you include a <cacheControl> directive, it will be used to
         generate a Cache-Control header (as well as an Expires header
         if the value contains "max-age=")

         By default, no Cache-Control header is generated.

         You can use the <cacheControl> option even if you have set
         never304="true"
      -->
    <!--
       <httpCaching never304="true" >
         <cacheControl>max-age=30, public</cacheControl>
       </httpCaching>
      -->
    <!-- To enable Solr to respond with automatically generated HTTP
         Caching headers, and to response to Cache Validation requests
         correctly, set the value of never304="false"

         This will cause Solr to generate Last-Modified and ETag
         headers based on the properties of the Index.

         The following options can also be specified to affect the
         values of these headers...

         lastModFrom - the default value is "openTime" which means the
         Last-Modified value (and validation against If-Modified-Since
         requests) will all be relative to when the current Searcher
         was opened.  You can change it to lastModFrom="dirLastMod" if
         you want the value to exactly correspond to when the physical
         index was last modified.

         etagSeed="..." is an option you can change to force the ETag
         header (and validation against If-None-Match requests) to be
         different even if the index has not changed (ie: when making
         significant changes to your config file)

         (lastModifiedFrom and etagSeed are both ignored if you use
         the never304="true" option)
      -->
    <!--
       <httpCaching lastModifiedFrom="openTime"
                    etagSeed="Solr">
         <cacheControl>max-age=30, public</cacheControl>
       </httpCaching>
      -->
